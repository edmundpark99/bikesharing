**_Module 14: Gathering Data on Bike Utilization_**

Tableau Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edmund.park4764

*Overview*

The purpose of this project was to gather data on bicycle usage in a city in order to see if a bike-sharing program is a good idea in the city of Des Moines. In this project, we used the program of Tableau to analyze gathered data on bike usage in the city based on various factors, and we aimed to mainly assess it based on how long individual bike trips were, what the gender of each bike user was, and how old each bike user was in order to identify times of day that bikes are most in use as well as dominant demographics of bike users. We made various vsualizations to gather the data on bike utilization in all of these aspects.

*Results*

![Checkout Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172080666-d9b9d611-82ad-4dee-9694-ee61b8b57371.png)

- Based on our first visualization, based on checkout times, it seems bikes are most often checked out for four-five minutes, or less than 20 minutes on a usual time scale. 

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172080808-3f6be0af-8c83-4899-9f28-7aacfc295df8.png)

- Based on our second visualization, dividing checkout times based on gender, the demographic within this given time of bike users is dominantly male, with female riders being the second most common demographic, and those who did not identify their gender making up the smallest proportion.

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172080992-f295df62-5444-4f37-a1db-b51d9bfdc1ad.png)

- Most bike trips in the city occur between 5 PM and 6 PM, and dominantly on Thursdays. Bike trips also happen to be common at 8 AM across the week, especially on Thursdays. It can be inferred these occur during hours that people are most likely to commute to and from home and work/school.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172081201-e11daa2a-21b6-457d-b355-1e86770861cd.png)

- Aligning with the previous two findings, based on this one, the times bike trips most prominently occur are similar, and most bike riders during these times are male.

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172081302-0b672df8-d558-4a66-b2e3-e0557dc74a84.png)

- Based on these, Thursday is the most prominent day for bike trips, with Monday, Tuesday, and Friday also being common ones, and the demographic of bike riders is dominantly male.

![Average Trip Duration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6594718/172081720-3021c776-b2f4-4021-af7e-01980632cdc9.png)

- In general, it would appear longer bike trips happen from those who were born later: however, those born in the 1890s stand out as a notable outlier.

- Bike utilization varies to different degrees amongst different bikes: this aligns with the general notion that some bike users utilize their bikes for longer durations of time and/or more frequently than others.

*Summary*

As an overall summary, a bike-sharing program does appear to be a good idea, and it would find its best business hours on Thursday evenings from 5 to 6 PM and at 8 AM across weekdays. The target demographic is dominantly male, but bike trips are most frequent from 5 to 6 PM on Thursday and at 8 AM as well. 8 AM is also a frequent time for bike trips across the city. These are easily inferred to be rush hours when people frequently commute from home to work and vice versa. Trips tent to last between 4-5 minutes.

As for two potential visualizations, there are two potential visualizations that could contribute valuable information:
- Across various points in the months to determine at which points in the year bikes are most frequently used.
- Location data: where bikes are most oftenly used and from what place to the next they are used.
